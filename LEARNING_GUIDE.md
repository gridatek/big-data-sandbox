# 📚 Learning Guide - Tutorials vs Examples

Welcome to the Big Data Sandbox! This guide explains the different learning resources and when to use each one.

## 🎯 Two Learning Paths

The Big Data Sandbox provides two complementary learning approaches:

### 📓 **Interactive Tutorials** (`jupyter/notebooks/`)
**Best for**: Learning concepts and hands-on exploration

### 🛠️ **Production Examples** (`examples/`)
**Best for**: Building real applications and understanding enterprise patterns
